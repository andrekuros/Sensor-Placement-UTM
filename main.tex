% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
The safe integration of Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) operations and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) into dense urban airspace requires robust Ground-Based Surveillance Systems (GBSS), yet no existing framework addresses the simultaneous challenges of high-fidelity urban modeling, multi-objective optimization, and real-world validation at city scale. This paper presents a holistic methodology that integrates four key components: (1) OpenStreetMap for automatic acquisition of building geometries from any city worldwide, (2) building-centric sensor placement leveraging rooftop infrastructure for enhanced line-of-sight and operational viability, (3) deterministic 3D ray-tracing for accurate propagation calculations with urban obstacles, and (4) parallelized multi-objective optimization via NSGA-II discovering Pareto-optimal trade-offs between coverage, redundancy, and cost. The framework optimizes heterogeneous sensor networks (Radar, RF, Electro-Optical, Acoustic) across 50-100 candidate locations—previously intractable—discovering continua of non-dominated solutions rather than prescribing single configurations, enabling infrastructure selection based on operational context and risk profiles. Real-world validation with São Paulo's Avenida Paulista (4,921 buildings, 2.94 km², 99 rooftop sites) achieves 94.3\% coverage with mean sensor heights of 82m, generating 15 Pareto-optimal solutions spanning redundancy 5.87-21.9 and cost 42-147 UoM. This represents the largest urban GBSS placement study in literature—50x larger than prior work—demonstrating global applicability and providing the first computationally viable tool for prescriptive UTM infrastructure planning at city scale.
